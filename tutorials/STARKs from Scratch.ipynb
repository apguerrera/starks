    "In this tutorial, we're going to aim to construct a simple STARK from scratch. We'll use a number of the pieces you've seen from the previous tutorials, so I highly recommend working through those earlier tutorials before taking on this tutorial.\n",

    "Put another way, a STARK is a tool for succinctly proving something. You might also hear about zk-STARKs. Here, zk stands for \"zero-knowledge.\" In this tutorial, we won't work out the zero-knowledge transformation for STARKs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, construct a STARK can be thought of taking the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transforming your computation into an appropriate polynomial (Arithmetization)\n",
    "2. Prove that this polynomial has low degree (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this tutorial, we'll unpack both of these steps and dive into more details on how this encoding is performed."
