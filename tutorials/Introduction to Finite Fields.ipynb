    "In this tutorial, we'll teach you about the basics of working with finite fields. Finite fields are very useful mathematical objects that pop up everywhere in cryptography. What is a \"finite field\" you might ask? Before we get into this, it might be useful to first review the mathematical concept of a \"field\".\n",

    "A field is simply any set where you can add, sutract, multiply, and divide numbers. (You might protest you can't divide by 0. That's a special case handled differently). What are some other examples of fields you might have seen? Well likely the rational numbers\n",

    "Ok, you might now be feeling that fields are pretty common. What are some things that aren't fields? Well for starters, the set of whole numbers isn't a field. Why not? You can add, subtract, and multiply whole numbers, but you can't divide them. For example\n",
